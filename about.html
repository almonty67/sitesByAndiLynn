          	      <h3>More About Me</h3>
          	         <p>When I tried a few years ago to build my own e-commerce website well it was a disaster to say the least. Now this was way before Wordpress became the "in" thing. I wound up hiring Dannielyn who in my opinoin is an awesome web developer. She helped me get my website up and runinng making the website gorgeous. She understood my personality and what I wanted, and we had never even met in person. From those days back a few years ago she got me interested in how she got my website to come alive. She doesnt even know this as I never got the chance to tell her. I hope we are able to cross paths one day again and let her now just how much her devotion to web development became my dream aslo.</p>
