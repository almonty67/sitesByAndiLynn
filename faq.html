        I have always loved to problem solve and I am a very analytical thinker. I Google anything and everthing. I had a friend mention that I should look into Web Developing because of my love for Googling. As I looked into it I realized that this is what I tried to do a few years ago when I was wanting to sell some products and wanted a website for it. As I said previously 
          I hired a great Web Developer ( though at the time I had no idea what a Web Developer)and was amazed at what she had done. I had been curious over the years and now I am so happy I made this career change. I can not wait to get out there and help others get beautiful websites up and running.

            Why Did You Pick CareerFoundry For You Education?    </a>

    <div class="panel-body">
       I started taking some courses thru different online websites but found CareerFoundry to be my best fit. In my opinion Careerfoundry has the best way of learning as it is completely hands on. For me watching videos does nothing for me. I am a hands on person and have to do things as I go along. I am ADD and the only way for me to learn to do it. I can not say enough about CareerFoundry and their method of learning. I hope this helps others make a decision if they are looking for a great way to learn to become a Web Developer!

         At this time since I am still learning it is just me. In the near future I hope to be building websites along side my Fiancè and my daughter. My Finacè is Internet Security and my daughter will be starting Web Design. Possibly my future daughter-in-law and son-in-law also will be a part of the team. Not only are we a close family but all will work together great as a team. Everyone has their own individual talents that will be broguht to the table for clients.
